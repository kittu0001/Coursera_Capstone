    "Road accidents are extremely common. Often times they lead to a loss of property and even life. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to understand what are the most common causes, in order to prevent them from happening? With this analysis, I am attempting to understand these factors and their correlation. This analysis has multiple applications like an app that will prompt the drivers to be more careful depending on the weather and road conditions on any given day or a way for the police to enforce more safety protocols.In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithim must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful. In this instance, I am using the data from the City of Seattle’s police department showing all the collisions from 2004 till present."
